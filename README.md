# K-Means-Clustering
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. In contrast to traditional supervised machine learning algorithms, K-Means attempts to classify data without having first been trained with labeled data. Once the algorithm has been run and the groups are defined, any new data can be easily assigned to the most relevant group.
Often times the data youâ€™ll be working with will have multiple dimensions making it difficult to visual. As a consequence, the optimum number of clusters is no longer obvious. Fortunately, we have a way of determining this mathematically.
We graph the relationship between the number of clusters and Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) then we select the number of clusters where the change in WCSS begins to level off (elbow method).
